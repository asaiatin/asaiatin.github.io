<p class="message">
  I read and whine. Ocassionaly write. It's mostly a storm of thoughts that I try to structure and present here in future :)
</p>

I will try to pin down all the things I'd listed down on my Notion space. I was supposed to give a deep thought but in run-of-a-mill schedule, fell behind on my commitment.

Professionally - I work as Product Manager at ICC – I know, even I didn’t think it’d have such a role but I somehow landed here. Previously, I had worked in a fintech startup & media tech company (now an unicorn) as PM leading social products. I purely got lucky there but made most of it :)

Personally - I try to claim as much time as possible so that I don't become a living machine and keep enjoying things that keep me sane eg. reading fiction like I did in school and college while maintaining a healthy mix of non-fiction and gyaan.

Quizzing, random reading on geopolitics, finance and humour are my go to actvity. Take pride in watching some not so mainstream shows. I pretend I watch movies but I literally don't.

This site would have two sections:
1. Personal
2. Professional

I aim to write lessons & observation from my life here along with professional gyan too. I will also cover why I named this blog "Horizon". Stay tuned.

In case you're wondering why I picked Jekyll and not a plane jane Wordpress blog, the reasons are as follows:
1. WP has too many options in terms of customization and themes, I'd forever keep changing that instead of posting.
2. Loved how simple and elegant Jekyll is. Plus it's markup. Literally HTML, will live on forever, unlike products that I make and sunset. One way to hack my own legacy. LOL.
3. I do three git command to make it live and get full hackerman feel. #workintech
