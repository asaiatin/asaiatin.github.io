<p class="message">
  I read and whine. Ocassionaly write. It's mostly a storm of thoughts that I try to structure and present here in future :)
</p>

I will try to pin down all the things I'd listed down on my Notion space. I was supposed to give a deep thought but in run-of-a-mill schedule, fell behind on my commitment.

Professionally - I work as Product Manager in a fintech startup based out of Gurgaon (currently remote ofcourse). Previously, I had worked in a media tech company (now an unicorn) as PM leading social products. I purely got lucky there but made most of it :)

Personally - I try to claim as much time as possible so that I don't become a living machine and keep enjoying things that keep me sane eg. reading fiction like I did in school and college while maintaining a healthy mix of non-fiction and gyaan. 

Quizzing, random reading on geopolitics, finance and humour are my go to actvity. Take pride in watching some not so mainstream shows. I pretend I watch movies but I literally don't.

This site would have two sections:
1. Personal
2. Professional

I aim to write lessons & observation from my life here along with professional gyan too. Stay tuned.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to drop a DM @asaiatin or email at asaiatin@gmail.com

Thanks for reading!
