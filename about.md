<p class="message">
  I read and whine. Ocassionaly write. It's mostly a storm of thoughts that I try to structure and present here in future :)
</p>

I will try to pain down all the things I'd listed down on my Notion space. I was supposed to give a deep thought but in run-of-a-mill schedule, always fall behind my commitment.

Professionally - I work as Product Manager in a Series A, fintech startup based out of Gurgaon (currently remote ofcourse). Previously, I had worked in a media tech series D company (now an unicorn) as PM leading a crucial Social products. I purely got lucky there but made most of it :)

Personally - I try to claim as much time as possible so that I don't become a living machine and keep enjoying fiction like I did in school and college while maintaining a healthy mix of non-fiction and gyaan. 

Quizzing, random reading on geopolitics is my go to actvity. I love watching new tv shows - mostly feel good ones (think Kim's convinence and Seinfield). I secrelty love romcom but it comes out only on blunt questioning :P

This site would have two sections:
1. Personal
2. Professional

I aim to write lessons & observation from my life here along with professional gyan too. Stay tuned.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to drop a DM @asaiatin or email at asaiatin@gmail.com

Thanks for reading!
