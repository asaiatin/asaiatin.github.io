title: Getting in groove.

Ah, it's almost funny how I thought I'd set a weekly cadence and be more regular at writing. I literally woke up to writing a new  after almost 10 months. LOL.

To be fair - a lot of things happened in between. This also involved I moving abroad (YAY!), meeting some new people and getting back to fitness. Not all rosy things, also involved sunsetting a product that I poured by heart and mind which was a bummer of course. Happens, I know - still hurts :)

Also, I think I forgot the commands to commit from terminal as I messed up my Jekyll setup so here's another go at it from Github Desktop, will update more on this post.

Cheers!
