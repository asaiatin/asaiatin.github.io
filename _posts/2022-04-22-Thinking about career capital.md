title: Thinking of career capital
---
it's that time of year - when admits to global school start rolling out and a pretentious Linkedin is filled with the posts about folks joining a fancy $100K business school.

And for those not joining a fancy school - there's ofcourse "I'm now a Noogler post". <s> Give a year and FAANG will absorb literally every knowledge worker in India. </s>

LOL, last statement didn't age well. Thanks to US Federal reserve.

Anyway, back to topic - while I have nothing for good wishes for your fancy admit or dream job. Infact, for all qualms I have, I'm happy to see people achieve their potential but alas, comparision monkey (read competition) is so ingrained, in few weak moments, I do circle back to my various decisions that has landed me in my current situation - career wise. Before I garner pity - I think I've been more than lucky to have a nice gig, intellectial growth with excellent trajectory.

That however doesn't mean I will ever be content, years of conditioning of worrying about future won't just go away in a smack, right?

And as I recently hit my official milestone of venturing into late 20s - colloquial anxiety has again piqued. It's almost ironical how I took a leave on 15th (Friday) motivated to dedicate the day to self care and ended up partially panicking with writing a note on possible path ahead. This also got amplified by conversation with my folks where I was told to make up my mind on next organic milestone of personal life (read marriage) where principal argument were the "receding market of eligible bachelor" and how this is right age to get settled where I got ambush-advised by multiple unrelated people at random places with advice that I have to admit made sort of sense, bizzarely. And I'm not going to discuss it here, maybe another post.

Anywho - I wrote this post near about August and a lot has happened since then, the tech stock market has virtually crashed. Almost all big tech has had layoffs and Indian companies are following the lead. Economic slowdown was expected, crash was imminent, valuation hit were expected but layoffs are always uncomfortable. Specially  in firms with comfortable FCF and herculean margin. Why would Apple even think of freeze is literally beyond me but it does show that at the end, it's shareholder value that's supreme. No matter your market share or cash!

This begs to answer if all we do is even worth it. Let's clarify one thing before venturing deep, which is :
<s> Nothing is ever enough </s>

Unless you hit a colloquial lottery - you'd almost always be working to next milestone with no FatFire in sight.
For last decade, the definition of lottery for knowledge worked in tech was :
1.Joining early stage and hope it becomes big  (High Risk)
2.FAANG gig with refreshers (Low risk as liquid and always go up)

What has happened now is
