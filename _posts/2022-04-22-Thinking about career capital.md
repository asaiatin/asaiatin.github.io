title: Thinking of career capital
---
it's that time of year - when admits to global school start rolling out and a pretentious Linkedin is filled with the posts about folks joining a fancy $100K business school.

And for those not joining a fancy school - there's ofcourse "I'm now a Noogler post". <s>Give a year and FAANG will observe literally every knowledge worked in India. </s>

LOL, last statement didn't age well. Thanks to US Federal reserve.

Anyway, back to topic - while I have nothing for good wishes for your fancy admit or dream job. Infact, for all qualms I have, I'm happy to see people achieve their potential but alas, comparision (read competition) is so ingrained, on few weak moments, I do circle back to my various decisions that has landed me in my current situation - career wise. Before I garner pity - I think I've been more than lucky to have a high paying, fancy gig with a good charter etc.

That however doesn't mean I will ever be content, years of conditioning of worrying about future won't just go away in a smack, right?

And as I recently hit my official milestone of venturing into late 20s - colloquial anxiety has again piqued. It's almost ironical how I took a leave on 15th (Friday) motivated to dedicate the day to self care and ended up partially panicking with writing a note on possible path ahead. This also got amplified by conversation with my folks where I was told to make up my mind on next organic milestone of personal life (read marriage) where principal argument were the "receding market of eligible bachelor" and how this is right age to get settled where I got ambush-advised by multiple unrelated people at random places with advice that I have to admit made sort of sense, bizzarely. And I'm not going to discuss it here, maybe another post.

The fight is about to board so I'm gonna continue this later.
