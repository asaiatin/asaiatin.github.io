We all have come across the joke about PM not knowing a thing, right? Well. I guess it's right. Legit took a month to get this online. LOL.

### Built on Poole

Would have done lot ealier but this theme took my breath away. SO ofcourse, I would spend excruciating hours to get this up instead of standard theme. Took about obsession just like when you want the button to be of a color!

### Lanyon features

Loos clean, dayum. That's all you should know and appreciate.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
