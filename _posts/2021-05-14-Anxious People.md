<strong> Anxious People </strong>
By Fredrik Backman
I really thoughs it's a book with a lot of humour - a wee bit light hearted. But 20% in, defintely is a serial hitter.

Ofcourse, there's  millenial language and thus implied charm but just couldn't stop feeling bad for the protagonist!

Really wished Kindle allowed sharing highlights more seemlessly. Until I figure that part out, will be posting my comments and eventually highlights in forms of quotes here.
