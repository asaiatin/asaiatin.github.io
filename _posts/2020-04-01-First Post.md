title: Your work and identity
---

This post is a resultant of lot of my thoughts around the topic related to my work and everyday life. It's an evolving thought and this is an evolving post, I'll keep it updating.

The solace I have right now is the blog is really unknown so I can publish incomplete article which inturn will force me to refine and post things entirely due to partial OCD of not letting things go un-answered.


### Genesis

Post undergrad,  finding an enthralling job in the heart of Bengaluru was part luck, part effort. I quiet honestly didn't know where I landed. As it was directly on-campus and let me postpone my MBA plans, I was mroe than happy to take it up. Little did I know that I'd everntually land in the midst of most promising time on the second deecade of 21st century India, <strong> The Private Boom </strong>

Basically this was the "Startup" scene that had started making big noises - From big valuation to reverse brain drain. The place that I joiend as management trainee/business analyst would go on to raise multi miliion dollars from marquee investors and become India's first tech-media unicorn. Anyways, the story isn't about it. But dope genesis though, right? :P


### Wait where does the identity comes in?

We like patterns. We search for them everywhere. We all are Analysts in day to day life.
> Punjab mail comes late thrice a week, specially on Monday. We'll plan accoridngly.

This insightful line came from my dad, who's nowhere close to Data Analyst but wouldn't you say this is a classic prediction basis historical data, no matter the sophistication!

So beating around the bush, this post boils down in the following way: My first place of work - that gave me first glimspe of "work" and how it influence my idea of work life balance, my idea of identity given the usual human interaction, my second job which gave a good perspective and changed some old and so on.
