title: Your work and identity
---

This post is a resultant of lot of my thoughts around the topic related to my work and everyday life. It's an evolving thought and this is an evolving post, I'll keep it updating.

The solace I have right now is the blog is really unknown so I can publish incomplete article which inturn will force me to refine and post things entirely due to partial OCD of not letting things go un-answered.


### Genesis

Post undergrad,  finding an enthralling job in the heart of Bengaluru was part luck, part effort. I quiet honestly didn't know where I landed. As it was directly on-campus and let me postpone my MBA plans, I was more than happy to take it up. Little did I know that I'd everntually land in the midst of most promising time time and place of the decade, <strong> The Private Boom </strong>

Basically this was the "Startup" scene that had started making big noises - From big valuation to reverse brain drain. The place that I joiend as management trainee/business analyst would go on to raise multi miliion dollars from marquee investors and become India's first tech-media unicorn. Anyways, the story isn't about it. But dope genesis though, right? :P


### Wait where does the identity comes in?

We like patterns. We search for them everywhere. We all are Analysts in day to day life.
> Punjab mail comes late thrice a week, specially on Monday. We'll plan accoridngly.

This insightful line came from my dad, who's nowhere close to Data Analyst but wouldn't you say this is a classic prediction basis historical data, no matter the sophistication!

So beating around the bush, this post boils down in the following way: My first place of work - that gave me first glimspe of "work" and how it influence my idea of work life balance, my idea of identity given the usual human interaction, my second job which gave a good perspective and changed some old and so on.

### The first ecounter

The first place that I worked had everything you'd want in a good workplace. Great career path, great manager, awesome projects, steady pay.

But if you're an ambitious 23 yo above average dude. Is your male ego ever <em>satisfied?</em> 

And ofcourse the comparision monkey suddenly wakes up benchmarking me with my friends who frankly are the most pampered of the lot - the scarce <strong>Backend developers</strong>. Can poor PMs even compete with the lot?

Anyway, long story short - desperate to turbo boost my career. I decided to take a plunge in dark alley of early stage startup and that's when things started to change.


### The paradox of work-life balance

>It's one of those things which you can feel but not notice but when you don't fee it, you do notice.

Things were always rosy in my first stint too but you largely fall in two categories: Either and love, embrace and thriv ein high pressure 24*7 gig or you don't.
As per my limited 3 years observation - no one thing is better than another, it really depends on individual. 

I personally feel for knowledge work, you need a good 50-50 or 60-40 creativity:hard work ratio. Creativity fosters you to think criticially and seemlessly - best for product and coders alike while hard work is basically your perseverance since most problems won't get solved in 5 min and you've to be at it. Plus the way modern offices and collaborations works is basically you need more documentation and lot of grunt tasks to be done so at a point, it is tranferrable. You can be a mad genuis but you really are on your own while doing the latter part.
