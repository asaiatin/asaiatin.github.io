title: Your work and identity
---

This post is a resultant of lot of my thoughts around the topic related to my work and everyday life. It's an evolving thought and this is an evolving post, I'll keep it updating.

The solace I have right now is the blog is really unknown so I can publish incomplete article which inturn will force me to refine and post things entirely due to partial OCD of not letting things go un-answered.


### Genesis

Post undergrad,  finding an enthralling job in the heart of Bengaluru was part luck, part effort. I quiet honestly didn't know where I landed. As it was directly on-campus and let me postpone my MBA plans, I was more than happy to take it up. Little did I know that I'd everntually land in the midst of most promising time time and place of the decade, <strong> The Private Boom </strong>

Basically this was the "Startup" scene that had started making big noises - From big valuation to reverse brain drain. The place that I joiend as management trainee/business analyst would go on to raise multi miliion dollars from marquee investors and become India's first tech-media unicorn. Anyways, the story isn't about it. But dope genesis though, right? :P


### Wait where does the identity comes in?


So what I have noticed in the recent past is that your identity somehow is very close related to work and that happens more in the context man compare to anyone else the reason being the intense focus someone on that gender is faced in terms of how he is supposed to be the primary breadwinner even though quality Quality has more or less increased yet it's said on the male ego or it's a statement on mail equal that you're not able to on and provide for your family then there is some classic basic

Part of it is in bread from the beginning from the childhood a part of it is when you see your friends or your colleagues conversing and you realise how it's very important for everyone to progress professionally because of that what we do we spoke we put our own personal desires on the backburner which leads to more stress eventually because you're not enjoying the difficult things that you enjoyed in the past for example I realise that now I don't feel like reading fiction as much as I would have liked back in my school or college and the reason being that the intense feeling of getting pushed back or getting left behind because and not being up to the speed on the most happening of the day call my domain or product or business and that it leads to more pressure and thereby less balance in terms of all you want to go beyond your work or the kind of work place is also good indicator of how they treat you as an employee but I still think that something which is too far-fetched or too much to expect from workplace anyone who has worked with cofounders who have been a much a balance life has a positive impact on your knowledge for this part creativity part logic so you have to be able to have a good combination of open thinking which is creativity and ability to Grant Road by persevering for the difficult parts of the day it's a documentation for example
