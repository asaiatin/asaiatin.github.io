title: Your work and identity
---

This post is a resultant of lot of my thoughts around the topic related to my work and everyday life. It's an evolving thought and this is an evolving post, I'll keep it updating.

The solace I have right now is the blog is really unknown so I can publish incomplete article which inturn will force me to refine and post things entirely due to partial OCD of not letting things go un-answered.


### Genesis

Post undergrad,  finding an enthralling job in the heart of Bengaluru was part luck, part effort. I quiet honestly didn't know where I landed. As it was directly on-campus and let me postpone my MBA plans, I was more than happy to take it up. Little did I know that I'd everntually land in the midst of most promising time time and place of the decade, admist the private boom of huge capital influx - possibly due to increased US liquidity or you know, promise for India's growth!

The place that I joiend as management trainee/business analyst would go on to raise multi miliion dollars from marquee investors and become India's first tech-media unicorn. Anyways, the story isn't about it. But dope genesis though, right? :P


### Wait where does the identity comes in?
