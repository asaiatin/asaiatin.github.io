Life Lessons (?)

Yes, There’s a reason I have put a “?” as I’m reasonably confident but still not 100% sure.
But then again, can anyone ever be!

<UL>
<li> Seeing your loved ones happy and healthy 
No amount of wealth matches the sheer pleasure of seeing people that you truly love being happy and content. You got to experience it to know it, you might not get it until you’re mature or maybe someone close to you go through a crisis or just see your parents ageing but if they (parents, close friends, partner, siblings) are content. What a feeling ??
